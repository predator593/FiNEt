- This project is based on the Neso academy
- [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZTQ61njgKI)  and other counter youtube channels regarding  how to find subnets in a given number of hosts , 

- I hope all the efforts which I took might benefit at least a few people who might be preparing for the CCNA courses and all if there is any  changes that you are require , please feel free to notify me .
- 
- This is an open source available program .
- 
- The input requires you to input the IP address and the CIDR value (eg: 192.3.6.5/4) & no.of hosts (eg: 45)
- 
- it would then display the no.of IP range available starting from the Next preceding range if there is any updates that i male on the code I would definitly update it the code .
